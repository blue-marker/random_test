Weiss Phase 2.3
------------------------

Bullish (default) > Neutral > Parabloic2 > Parabolic1 > Bearish 
----------------------------------------------------------------
New Low and High should be taken after one day



Neutral Start: if CP is less than Low80 or Low80_VTL

Neutral Ends:  if CP is greater than High80 or High80_VTL

----------------------------------------------------------------

Parabolic2 Range: range = ((PreviousHigh320 - CurrentLow320)*3) + PreviousHigh320

Parabolic2 Start: if CP is greater than above range (will check until second High80)

Parabolic2 Ends: if CP is less than FLD20 

1. After the Parabolic2 ends Neutral Phase will Start by default
2. if during this Neutral phase CP is greater than the MAX value found in Parabolic2, then Parabolic2 will start again
3. Otherwise the Neutral will end normally i.e when CP is greater than High80 only

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Parabolic1 Range: if CP is greater than High80_VTL, then range = ((CP-PreviousLow320)*2.67) + CP

(Note: when Low320 is not available (NA), we will take the lowest CP till date )


Parabolic1 Start: if CP is greater than the above range and High80_VTL has a positive slope 

a. this condition will be checked until next High80
b. if the condition is not satisfied then the Parabolic Range condition is again checked from the next row
c. if Parabolic1 is not found even after sliding down until the next High80, 
   then the Parabolic1 condition is not checked until next Low320


Parabolic1 Ends:  if CP is less than FLD20

1. After the Parabolic1 ends Neutral Phase will Start by default and will end
only if CP crosses High80


Under this Neutral phase Bearish will only begin if certain conditions are meet and they are as follows

1. After Neutral phase starts, if CP crosses above 20-day FLD and again crosses below 20-day FLD, then Bearish phase begin
2. if CP goes below the last 20 day low.

Just like in parabolic2, if CP crosses the highest point of parabolic phase during neutral phase, it goes back to parabolic 


Virtual Low in 320:   

Once we have 4 confirmed 80-day Lows after a 320-day Low then we calculate vector for each one of them

 1. calculate vector = sqrt((price_low - price_high)^2 + (day_low - day_high)^2), for each of these lows and then find the max vector 
   
    (price_high is price of prevHigh80 of that low80)

 2. the low corresponds to the max vector will be our “virtual 320 low”

The "virtual 320 low" will be used as the 320 low from that low until next 320 low.
and then we will move to next 320 low


Note: We will be using Virtual Low only for Parabolic 1
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bearish Start: if CP is less than Low320

Bearish End:
a. if CP is greater than High80_VTL, then Neutral phase starts

   Neutral Ends: 
   i.  if CP is greater than High80 then Bullish phase starts
   ii. if CP is less than Low80 then Bearish phase starts  
  

b. if CP is greater than High80, then Bullish phase starts
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All crosses will be checked for x consecutive days
